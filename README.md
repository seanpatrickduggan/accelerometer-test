This is the first test I created for a model rocket telemetry system. The goal is to be able to use the logic in a custom build PCB using an RP2040 microcontroller, and store the telemetry data onto an SD card, which can than be parsed later to find information about a rocket's flight.

Currently I am using Alex Mous's library, but the comonents are expected to change:
